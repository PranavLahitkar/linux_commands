# The `last` command

This command shows you a list of all the users that have logged in and out since the creation of the `var/log/wtmp` file. There are also some parameters you can add which will show you for example when a certain user has logged in and how long he was logged in for.

If you want to see the last 5 logs, just add `-5` to the command like this:

```
last -5
```

And if you want to see the last 10, add `-10`.

Another cool thing you can do is if you add `-F` you can see the login and logout time including the dates.

```
last -F
```

There are quite a lot of stuff you can view with this command. If you need to find out more about this command you can run:

```
last --help
```
