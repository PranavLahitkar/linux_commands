# The `mpstat` command

The `mpstat` command is used to report processor related statistics. It accurately displays the statistics of the CPU usage of the system and information about CPU utilization and performance.

### Syntax:

```
mpstat [options] [<interval> [<count>]]
```

#### Note : It initializes the first processor with CPU 0, the second one with CPU 1, and so on.

### Options and their Functionalities:

|**Option**   |**Description**                                                       |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`-A`         |to display all the detailed statistics                                |
|`-h`         |to display mpstat help                                                |
|`-I`         |to display detailed interrupts statistics                             |
|`-n`         |to report summary CPU statistics based on NUMA node placement         |
|`-N`         |to indicate the NUMA nodes for which statistics are to be reported    |
|`-P`         |to indicate the processors for which statistics are to be reported    |
|`-o`         |to display the statistics in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format |
|`-T`         |to display topology elements in the CPU report                        |
|`-u`         |to report CPU utilization                                             |
|`-v`         |to display utilization statistics at the virtual processor level      |
|`-V`         |to display mpstat version                                             |
|`-ALL`       |to display detailed statistics about all CPUs                         |


### Examples:

1. To display processor and CPU statistics:
```
mpstat
```

2. To display processor number of all CPUs:
```
mpstat -P ALL
```

3. To get all the information which the tool may collect: 
```
mpstat -A
```

4. To display CPU utilization by a specific processor: 
```
mpstat -P 0
```

5. To display CPU usage with a time interval:
``` 
mpstat 1 5
```
**Note: This command will print 5 reports with 1 second time interval**
