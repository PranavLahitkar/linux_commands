# The `whois` command

The `whois` command in Linux to find out information about a domain, such as the owner of the domain, the ownerâ€™s contact information, and the nameservers that the domain is using.

```
whois -H {Domain_name}
```

### Syntax:

```
whois [ -h HOST ] [ -p PORT ] [ -aCFHlLMmrRSVx ] [ -g SOURCE:FIRST-LAST ] 
      [ -i ATTR ] [ -S SOURCE ] [ -T TYPE ] object
```
```
whois -t TYPE
```
```
whois -v TYPE
```
